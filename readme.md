Cosmic Analysis - Mutation Distribution
========

### CODE ###
#### /analysis ####
R scripts running computational statistics technique are available in the analysis folder. Also contains python script for graphing the observed frequencies

#### /data ####
The python script for processing the raw data into cleaned data is available in the data folder as data/DataProcessingPipeline.ipynb


### TECHNIQUES USED ###
*   Density Graphs
*   Bootstrapping
*   Permutation Test
*   ECDF Graphs
*   Smoothing Techniques - Constant Span Running Mean & Kernel

### EXPLANATION FOR DISTRIBUTION VARIATIONS ###
1) Stability of Nucleotides & their sensitivity to mutagens
2) Fidelity of DNA Replication
3) Efficiency of DNA Repair Machinery
4) Epigenetic Mechanisms, E.g. Methylation
